* To-do
- [X] rustfmt
- [X] make client print local addr - nah
- [X] simplify log_socket_error
  - Yes, it's 'production-quality' to include the socket name, but the
    complexity is a distraction.
- [X] test on mac
- [X] import from `std` or `async_std` consistently
- [X] use 'socket', not 'connection'
- [X] re-examine all function names
- [ ] check panic handling
- [ ] understand genawaiter
* Things to test
- server drops group member when client closes connection
- server drops group member when send fails
