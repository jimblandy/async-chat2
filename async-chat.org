* To-do
- [ ] rexamine all function names
- [ ] use 'socket', not 'connection'
- [ ] make client print local addr
- [ ] rustfmt
- [ ] test on mac
- [ ] simplify log_socket_error
  - Yes, it's 'production-quality' to include the socket name, but the
    complexity is a distraction.
* Things to test
- server drops group member when client closes connection
- server drops group member when send fails
